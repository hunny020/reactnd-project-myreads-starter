# MyReads Project

This project is a bookshelf app for avid readers. It helps users manage their books into 3 shelves:
  1. Currently Reading
  2. Want to Read
  3. Read

User can switch any given book between one of these 3 shelves.

The app also has a "Search section" where user can search books of their interests using particular
predefined keywords. These keywords can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md
User can put a book which comes in search results into one of his shelves.
